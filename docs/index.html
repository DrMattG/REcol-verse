Understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling biodiversity patterns is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally accepted that both deterministic and stochastic processes play important roles in community assembly, quantifying their relative importance is challenging. The new index, normalized stochasticity ratio (NST), is to estimate ecological stochasticity, i.e. relative importance of stochastic processes, in community assembly. With functions in this package, NST can be calculated based on different similarity metrics and/or different null model algorithms, as well as some previous indexes, e.g. previous Stochasticity Ratio (ST), Standard Effect Size (SES), modified Raup-Crick metrics (RC). Functions for permutational test and bootstrapping analysis are also included. Previous ST is published by Zhou et al (2014) &lt;doi:10.1073/pnas.1324044111&gt;. NST is modified from ST by considering two alternative situations and normalizing the index to range from 0 to 1 (Ning et al 2019) &lt;doi:10.1073/pnas.1904623116&gt;. A modified version, MST, is a special case of NST, used in some recent or upcoming publications, e.g. Liang et al (2019) &lt;doi:10.1101/638908&gt;. SES is calculated as described in Kraft et al (2011) &lt;doi:10.1126/science.1208584&gt;. RC is calculated as reported by Chase et al (2011) &lt;doi:10.1890/es10-00117.1&gt; and Stegen et al (2013) &lt;doi:10.1038/ismej.2013.93&gt;.","Interpretation of time series data is affected by model choices. Different models can give different or even contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms for the same data--a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change,seasonality, and trend (BEAST) of this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition by forgoing the \"single-best-model\" concept and embracing all competing models into the inference via a Bayesian model averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data. Details on BEAST are reported in Zhao et al. (2019) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.rse.2019.04.034&gt;.","Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint  (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional  delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement. See Beule &amp; Karlovsky (2020) &lt;doi:10.7717/peerj.9593&gt; for details.","Provides a flexible simulation tool for phylogenetic trees under a general model for speciation and extinction. Trees with a user-specified number of extant tips, or a user-specified stem age are simulated. It is possible to assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation and extinction. Furthermore, the waiting times to speciation / extinction may be scaled in different parts of the tree, meaning we can simulate trees with clade-dependent diversification processes. At a speciation event, one species splits into two. We allow for two different modes at these splits: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. The symmetric mode can be seen as an vicariant or allopatric process where divided populations suffer equal evolutionary forces while the asymmetric mode could be seen as a peripatric speciation where a mother lineage continues to exist.

To develop bacterial identification algorithms (e.g. machine learning) using this glycolipid technology, it is necessary to generate a large number of various in-silico polymicrobial mass spectra that are similar to real mass spectra. 'MGMS2' (Membrane Glycolipid Mass Spectrum Simulator) generates such in-silico mass spectra, considering errors in m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) and variances of intensity values, occasions of missing signature ions, and noise peaks. It estimates summary statistics of monomicrobial mass spectra for each strain or species and simulates polymicrobial glycolipid mass spectra using the summary statistics of monomicrobial mass spectra.

For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-randomly attaching species or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating supertrees or consensus phylogenies from a set, for simulating trees and phylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide variety of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists might find useful in their research.","Provide function that reads binary genotype produced by 'PLINK' &lt;https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#bed&gt; into a R matrix, or scan the genotype one variant at a time like apply(), it also provides functions that reads and writes genotype relatedness/kinship matrices created by 'PLINK' &lt;https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/distance#make_rel&gt; or 'GCTA' &lt;https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#MakingaGRM&gt;.

Existing evolutionary simulation tools focus on simulations in a limited experimental framework, and tend to report on only the results presumed of interest by the tools designer. The R-package for Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution ('rSHAPE') addresses these concerns by implementing a robust simulation framework that outputs complete population demographic and genomic information for in silico evolving communities. Allowing more than 60 parameters to be specified, 'rSHAPE' simulates evolution across discrete time-steps for an evolving community of haploid asexual populations with binary state genomes. These settings are for the current state of 'rSHAPE' and future steps will be to increase the breadth of evolutionary conditions permitted. At present, most effort was placed into permitting varied growth models to be simulated (such as constant size, exponential growth, and logistic growth) as well as various fitness landscape models to reflect the evolutionary landscape (e.g.: Additive, House of Cards - Stuart Kauffman and Simon Levin (1987) &lt;doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(87)80029-2&gt;, NK - Stuart A. Kauffman and Edward D. Weinberger (1989) &lt;doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80019-0&gt;, Rough Mount Fuji - Neidhart, Johannes and Szendro, Ivan G and Krug, Joachim (2014) &lt;doi:10.1534/genetics.114.167668&gt;). This package includes numerous functions though users will only need defineSHAPE(), runSHAPE(), shapeExperiment() and summariseExperiment(). All other functions are called by these main functions and are likely only to be on interest for someone wishing to develop 'rSHAPE'. Simulation results will be stored in files which are exported to the directory referenced by the shape_workDir option (defaults to tempdir() but do change this by passing a folderpath argument for workDir when calling defineSHAPE() if you plan to make use of your results beyond your current session). 'rSHAPE' will generate numerous replicate simulations for your defined range of experimental parameters. The experiment will be built under the experimental working directory (i.e.: referenced by the option shape_workDir set using defineSHAPE() ) where individual replicate simulation results will be stored as well as processed results which I have made in an effort to facilitate analyses by automating collection and processing of the potentially thousands of files which will be created. On that note, 'rSHAPE' implements a robust and flexible framework with highly detailed output at the cost of computational efficiency and potentially requiring significant disk space (generally gigabytes but up to tera-bytes for very large simulation efforts). So, while 'rSHAPE' offers a single framework in which we can simulate evolution and directly compare the impacts of a wide range of parameters, it is not as quick to run as other in silico simulation tools which focus on a single scenario with limited output. There you have it, 'rSHAPE' offers you a less restrictive in silico evolutionary playground than other tools and I hope you enjoy testing your hypotheses.","An implementation of sensitivity analysis for phylogenetic comparative\r\n methods.

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear &amp; Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear &amp; Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).","Routines for identifying metabolic subpathways mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) through topologically locating miRNAs and genes within reconstructed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway graphs embedded by miRNAs.

The method allows for non-constant rates. Rates may change (1) as a function of time, i.e. rate shifts at specified times or mass extinction events (likelihood implemented as LikShifts, optimization as bd.shifts.optim and visualized as bd.shifts.plot) or (2) as a function of the number of species, i.e. density-dependence (likelihood implemented as LikDD and optimization as bd.densdep.optim) or (3) extinction rate may be a function of species age (likelihood implemented as LikAge and optimization as bd.age.optim.matlab). Note that the methods take into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the \"pull of the present\" effect. (1-3) can take into account incomplete species sampling, as long as each species has the same probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are missing), where the number of species is known within each higher taxa, speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model (1) (implemented within LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0). (ii) For a given phylogeny with sequentially sampled tips, e.g. a virus phylogeny, rates can be estimated under a model where rates vary across time using bdsky.stt.optim based on likelihood LikShiftsSTT (extending LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim). Furthermore, rates may vary as a function of host types using LikTypesSTT (multitype branching process extending functions in R package diversitree). This function can furthermore calculate the likelihood under an epidemiological model where infected individuals are first exposed and then infectious.","Simulation methods for phylogenetic trees where (i) all tips are sampled at one time point or (ii) tips are sampled sequentially through time. (i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa()), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age()), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age()). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m&gt;&gt;n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class. The function sim.genespeciestree() simulates coalescent gene trees within birth-death species trees, and sim.genetree() simulates coalescent gene trees.","Innovative Trend Analysis is a graphical method to examine the trends in time series data.
