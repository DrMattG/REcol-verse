The method compares the genotypes of offspring with any \n  combination of potentials parents and scores the number of mismatches of these \n  individuals at bi-allelic genetic markers (e.g. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). \n  It elaborates on a prior exclusion method based on the Homozygous Opposite Test \n  (HOT; Huisman 2017 &lt;doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12665&gt;) by introducing the \n  additional exclusion criterion HIPHOP (Homozygous Identical Parents, \n  Heterozygous Offspring are Precluded; Cockburn et al., in revision). Potential \n  parents are excluded if they have more mismatches than can \n  be expected due to genotyping error and mutation, and thereby one can identify the \n  true genetic parents and detect situations where one (or both) of the true \n  parents is not sampled. Package 'hiphop' can deal with (a) the case where there \n  is contextual information about parentage of the mother (i.e. a female has been \n  seen to be involved in reproductive tasks such as nest building), but paternity \n  is unknown (e.g. due to promiscuity), (b) where both parents need to be assigned, \n  because there is no contextual information on which female laid eggs and which \n  male fertilized them (e.g. polygynandrous mating system where multiple females \n  and males deposit young in a common nest, or organisms with external fertilisation \n  that breed in aggregations).\n    For details: Cockburn, A., Penalba, J.V.,Jaccoud, D.,Kilian, A., Brouwer, L.,\n       Double, M.C., Margraf, N., Osmond, H.L., van de Pol, M. and Kruuk, L.E.B. \n       (in revision).

Understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling biodiversity patterns is a central issue in ecology. Although it is generally accepted that both deterministic and stochastic processes play important roles in community assembly, quantifying their relative importance is challenging. The new index, normalized stochasticity ratio (NST), is to estimate ecological stochasticity, i.e. relative importance of stochastic processes, in community assembly. With functions in this package, NST can be calculated based on different similarity metrics and/or different null model algorithms, as well as some previous indexes, e.g. previous Stochasticity Ratio (ST), Standard Effect Size (SES), modified Raup-Crick metrics (RC). Functions for permutational test and bootstrapping analysis are also included. Previous ST is published by Zhou et al (2014) &lt;doi:10.1073/pnas.1324044111&gt;. NST is modified from ST by considering two alternative situations and normalizing the index to range from 0 to 1 (Ning et al 2019) &lt;doi:10.1073/pnas.1904623116&gt;. A modified version, MST, is a special case of NST, used in some recent or upcoming publications, e.g. Liang et al (2019) &lt;doi:10.1101/638908&gt;. SES is calculated as described in Kraft et al (2011) &lt;doi:10.1126/science.1208584&gt;. RC is calculated as reported by Chase et al (2011) &lt;doi:10.1890/es10-00117.1&gt; and Stegen et al (2013) &lt;doi:10.1038/ismej.2013.93&gt;.","Interpretation of time series data is affected by model choices. Different models can give different or even contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms for the same data--a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change,seasonality, and trend (BEAST) of this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition by forgoing the \"single-best-model\" concept and embracing all competing models into the inference via a Bayesian model averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data. Details on BEAST are reported in Zhao et al. (2019) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.rse.2019.04.034&gt;.","Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint  (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional  delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement. See Beule &amp; Karlovsky (2020) &lt;doi:10.7717/peerj.9593&gt; for details.","Provides a flexible simulation tool for phylogenetic trees under a general model for speciation and extinction. Trees with a user-specified number of extant tips, or a user-specified stem age are simulated. It is possible to assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation and extinction. Furthermore, the waiting times to speciation / extinction may be scaled in different parts of the tree, meaning we can simulate trees with clade-dependent diversification processes. At a speciation event, one species splits into two. We allow for two different modes at these splits: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. The symmetric mode can be seen as an vicariant or allopatric process where divided populations suffer equal evolutionary forces while the asymmetric mode could be seen as a peripatric speciation where a mother lineage continues to exist.
