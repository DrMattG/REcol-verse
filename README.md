# REcol-verse
Here is a list (https://drmattg.github.io/REcol-verse/) of R packages that are focused on Ecology, Evolution and Wildlife. The list is probably not complete so please add an issue (https://github.com/DrMattG/REcol-verse/issues) or contribute with a pull-request. 

## Development steps
* Integrate with awesome lists (https://github.com/DrMattG/REcol-verse/issues/3)

* Develop a shinyApp to facilitate freetext searches of package name and description
