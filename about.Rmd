The package is synchronized with the MetaboAnalyst web server. After installing and loading the package, users will be able to reproduce the same results from their local computers using the corresponding R command history downloaded from MetaboAnalyst web site, thereby achieving maximum flexibility and reproducibility.

The version 3.0 aims to improve the current global metabolomics workflow by implementing a fast parameter optimization algorithm for peak picking, and automated identification of the most suitable method for batch effect correction from 12 well-established approaches. In addition, more support for functional interpretation directly from m/z peaks via mummichog2 (PMID: 23861661), and a new pathway-based method to integrate multi'omics data has been added. To demonstrate this new functionality, we provide the \"MetaboAnalystR 3.0 Workflow: Towards an Optimized Workflow for Global Metabolomics\" vignette, available here as a PDF. In this vignette, we perform end-to-end metabolomics data analysis on the full batch of clinical IBD samples.","volePhD")

pkgs_short[nrow(pkgs_short) + 1,]<-c("spocc","A programmatic interface to many species occurrence data sources","At rOpenSci, we have been writing R packages to interact with many sources of species occurrence data, including GBIF, Vertnet, BISON, iNaturalist, the Berkeley ecoengine, and eBird. Other databases are out there as well, which we can pull in. spocc is an R package to query and collect species occurrence data from many sources. The goal is to to create a seamless search experience across data sources, as well as creating unified outputs across data sources.

spocc currently interfaces with nine major biodiversity repositories

Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (via rgbif) GBIF is a government funded open data repository with several partner organizations with the express goal of providing access to data on Earth's biodiversity. The data are made available by a network of member nodes, coordinating information from various participant organizations and government agencies.

Berkeley Ecoengine (via ecoengine) The ecoengine is an open API built by the Berkeley Initiative for Global Change Biology. The repository provides access to over 3 million specimens from various Berkeley natural history museums. These data span more than a century and provide access to georeferenced specimens, species checklists, photographs, vegetation surveys and resurveys and a variety of measurements from environmental sensors located at reserves across University of California's natural reserve system.

iNaturalist iNaturalist provides access to crowd sourced citizen science data on species observations.

VertNet (via rvertnet) Similar to rgbif, ecoengine, and rbison (see below), VertNet provides access to more than 80 million vertebrate records spanning a large number of institutions and museums primarly covering four major disciplines (mammology, herpetology, ornithology, and icthyology).

Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (via rbison) Built by the US Geological Survey's core science analytic team, BISON is a portal that provides access to species occurrence data from several participating institutions.

eBird (via rebird) ebird is a database developed and maintained by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society. It provides real-time access to checklist data, data on bird abundance and distribution, and communtiy reports from birders.

iDigBio (via ridigbio) iDigBio facilitates the digitization of biological and paleobiological specimens and their associated data, and houses specimen data, as well as providing their specimen data via RESTful web services.

OBIS OBIS (Ocean Biogeographic Information System) allows users to search marine species datasets from all of the world's oceans.

Atlas of Living Australia ALA (Atlas of Living Australia) contains information on all the known species in Australia aggregated from a wide range of data providers: museums, herbaria, community groups, government departments, individuals and universities; it contains more than 50 million occurrence records.

The inspiration for this comes from users requesting a more seamless experience across data sources, and from our work on a similar package for taxonomy data (taxize).

BEWARE: In cases where you request data from multiple providers, especially when including GBIF, there could be duplicate records since many providers' data eventually ends up with GBIF. See ?spocc_duplicates, after installation, for more.","StatsForBios")
